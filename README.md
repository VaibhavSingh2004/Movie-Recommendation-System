# Movie-Recommendation-System
This project recommends movies to users based on the similarity of their content or attributes. Instead of relying on user preferences or collaborative filtering, it analyzes movie features such as genre, cast, director, and plot summaries to suggest similar movies that align with the user's preferences.
